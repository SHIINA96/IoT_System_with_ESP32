# IoT-System-with-ESP32

A simple project to connect your ESP32 with MySQL database

In this project you will need a DHT11 sensor and a SG90 servo motorï¼Œmicrocontroller will upload temperature data and moisture data to your local MySQL database.  
You can set a specific temerature value to tell the servo how to work. Also you can choose which WiFi you want to connect.  

I'm still trying to get the database IP address from the serial monitor of arduino IDE. If you solved this problem, please leave a issue.
